You know, it really doesn’t matter what the media write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. Listen you mother fucker, we're going to tax you 25 percent!  When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.  The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our "leaders" can't say no!  "I will build a great wall — and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me —and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”
